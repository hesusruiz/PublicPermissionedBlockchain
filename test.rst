## Introduction

For many, using together the words "Public" and "Permissioned" when referring to a blockchain network, as in "Public-Permissioned blockchain" is a misnomer. Until now the words "Public" and "Permissioned" have been used as opposites, where "Permissioned" is seen as synonymous with "Private". However, as the following taxonomy shows, a new kind of blockchain network is emerging, being pioneered by https://alastria.io[Alastria].
