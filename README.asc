## Introduction

For many, using together the words "Public" and "Permissioned" when referring to a blockchain network, as in "Public-Permissioned blockchain" is a misnomer. Until now the words "Public" and "Permissioned" have been used as opposites, where "Permissioned" is seen as synonymous with "Private". However, as the following taxonomy shows, a new kind of blockchain network is emerging, being pioneered by https://alastria.io[Alastria].

### Objectives of this document

#### Auditability, Traceability, Strong Identities and proper Governance Model allow Performance with the right Safety

### Structure of this document

### Some notes on terminology

## The need for a Public-Permissioned network

### Current landscape

#### Public-Permissionless

#### Private Consortiums

### Problems of current blockchains

### Compare with public services

### Digitize a country economy

## Requirements for a Public-Permissioned blockchain

### Principles of Public-Permissioned

#### Adapt from EBSI

### For citizens

#### Inclusiveness

##### Not just for paranoids

#### Empowerment

#### Protection

#### Privacy

### Por businesses

#### Better collaboration

#### Better regulatory compliance

#### The right cost

### For Public Administrations

#### Collaboration with other administrations

#### Collaboration with private sector

#### Better citizen services

#### Improve transparency

#### Reduce fraud

#### Reduce cost

### For non-profit organizations

#### Better collaboration

#### Improve transparencyduce fraud

#### Reduce cost

### Strong identities

#### The world is Cyber-Physical

#### Transacting physical things requires identities

### Decentralization

#### The many faces of Decentralization

## The cost of Anonymity: the Blockchain Trilemma

### The Blockchain Trilemma

### The costs of Anonymity

### Permissioning/Identities change everything

### A little trust helps a lot

### Designed for the “normal” citizen

### The right balances and compromises

### The real economy needs real identities and an efficient legal system

#### The chain of responsibility

## Immutability (aka Safety)

### The cost of Anonymity

#### Anonimity requires Immutability

#### Lack of legal support requires Immutability

### Permissioning + Identities + Legal environment relaxes Immutability requirements

#### Immutability vs Auditability, Traceability

#### Tamper Evidence in Public-Permissioned

### Real Safety is higher in Public-Permissioned networks

### Immutability considered harmful

#### Need for a Tamper-evident erasable blockchain

### From the Trilemma to the Dilemma: The Trust Continuum

#### If Safety is assumed, the compromise is among Scalability and Decentralization

## Scalability

### The many faces of Scalability

#### Scalability on Performance

#### Scalability on number of Regular nodes

#### Scalability on Participating entities

#### Scalability on Consensus nodes

#### Scalability on geographical distribution

### The cost of Anonymity: Performance bottlenecks of Permissionless blockchains

#### Consensus algorithm

#### All nodes execute all transactions

#### PBFT-based consensus algorithms are more scalable 

##### Maintaining the same simple programming model for users

### The cost of Anonymity: Scalability on Participating entities

#### SMEs and citizens can not have a Full node

#### They require Light nodes, which are very difficult if maintain Safety

#### Many citizens and SMEs could participate via entities they trust at least partially

#### Very difficult to do in Permissionless because obligated subjects can not participate

### Scalability on number of Regular nodes

### Scalability on Consensus nodes (aka Consensus Algorithm)

#### Permissionless algorithms are very scalable (PoW, PoS)

##### But have low Performance

#### Pure PBFT-based algorithms are not scalable

#### PBFT and Decentralization

### Permissioning and Identities

## Decentralizacion

### The many faces of Decentralization

### The important thing is the citizen, not decentralization

### Attempting to measure Decentralization

### Decentralization in Public-Permissionless

#### Inclusiveness

#### Who controls the network?

#### Protection of the normal citizen

### Technical decentralization vs Real
decentralization

#### A world of compromises

### Public-Permissioned decentralization is better for the citizen

## Governance Model

### Association

### Platform

#### Off-chain

#### On-chain

##### Decentralized onboarding

###### Regular nodes

###### Block-maker nodes

##### Decentralized off-boarding

###### Regular nodes

###### Block-maker nodes

##### Transparent monitoring of the execution of Consensus algorithm

###### All network can see activity of block-maker nodes

###### All network can see failing or malicious block-maker nodes
    All participants in the network can have a dashboard to see the activity

##### More inclusive Block-maker set

###### Allow stand-by nodes

###### Proactive rotation of healthy nodes between active and stand-by sets

###### Management of faulty nodes
* Detection of Crash and Byzantine faults
* Excluding a failing node from the execution set
* Re-inclusion of a fixed node

## Sustainable operating model

### What is the cost of using the network

### Are there incentives for the block-maker nodes?

#### Economic

#### Marketing

#### Long-term investment

## Privacy of data and transactional activity

## Decentralized storage

## Low transaction costs

## Protection from overloading

### Protection from malicious nodes

### Protection from failing nodes

## Permissioning

## Protection from poisoning

## Appendix

### Conceptual architecture of Public-Permissioned

#### Regular nodes

#### Block-maker nodes

#### Consensus algorithms

#### Client nodes

### Mapping of Blockchain concepts to classical Distributed Systems

### Meaning of Decentralization

### Meaning of Scalability

### Immutability vs Auditability, Traceabilkity, Tamper Evidence
