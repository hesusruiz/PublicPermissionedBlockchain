The Alastria T Network is a blockchain network operated by some members of the Alastria association. The operation of the network is independent from the association, in the sense that the association (as a legal entity) has no control or decission power over the network. However, the entities operating the network assume voluntarily the compromise to comply with the principles of the association.

The T Network is a Public-Permissioned network, which combines *permissioning* with a **decentralized governance model**, allowing the blockchain to be managed as a **Common Good**. Very briefly, this means that the network is not controlled by any single company or group of companies, or even by a single government, and at the same time the network complies with all relevant regulations and it is efficient and sustainable.

== Introduction to Public-Permissioned blockchain networks

A Public-Permissioned blockchain network combines permissioning with a decentralized governance model, allowing the blockchain to be managed as a Common Good. Very briefly, this means that the network is not controlled by any single company or group of companies, or even by a single government, and at the same time the network complies with all relevant regulations and it is efficient and sustainable.

There is not a single way to achieve these objectives, but the T Network implements a specific governance model which arises from considering the blockchain network as a Common-Pool Resource (CPR) like the ones described by Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009. Ostrom focused on how communities manage to successfully govern communal resources, avoiding the “The tragedy of the commons” as described by Hardin.

A blockchain network can be considered as a technical infrastructure with scarce resources, given the inherent scaling problems of the technology. To be considered a common good, a Public-Permissioned blockchain network should comply with the following principles:

1. **Non-discriminatory and open access and usage**: Everybody has the right to join and use the infrastructure according to the access rules, which are fair, transparent and the same for everybody. In an analogy with the public roads of a country, everybody can drive a car, as far as they hold a valid driver’s license, and the car displays its plate.

2. **Open participation in governance**: Everybody has the right to participate in the construction, operation, provision, and governance of the infrastructure. The network should be inclusive, open to participation of any entity independent of size or sector of activity. Specifically, anybody can participate in the execution of the consensus algorithm used for the selection of transactions which go into the blocks.

3. **Inclusive participation in governance**: Influence in governance of the infrastructure should be independent of the size, wealth, sector of activity or any other factor. Specifically, voting power in the consensus algorithm should be independent of computing power available (PoW), assets available (PoS), or any other where the rich or powerful dominates over others. We could say that the consensus algorithm should be “as democratic as possible”, where one entity represents one vote.

4. **Juridical persons are never anonymous**: As in the real economy, the identities of juridical persons in the blockchain are public and well-known. In addition, even though their transactional activity may be private with respect to other actors (e.g. competitors), it is never private with respect to regulators or other controlling and law enforcement bodies (e.g. tax agencies or industry watchdogs).

5. **Consumer protection is ensured**: Normally natural persons do not participate directly in the blockchain because they do not run or operate a full node. Instead, they typically participate indirectly and so they must somehow trust some other actors. In any case, independently of whether participation of a natural person is direct or indirect, the system must always ensure that all applicable regulations on consumer protection apply, including personal data protection regulations.

== The architecture of the T Network

The T Network uses an EEA (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) client called Consensys Quorum. As the interoperability specifications in the EEA matures, it is anticipated that other implementations of the EEA specs will be used simultaneously in the network, in the short term Hyperledger Besu and later other implementations.

The description of the architecture is highly independent of the specific type of client used, so we will use the name Quorum only when some specif feature of the Consensys Quorum implementation is used.

In the T Network there are basically three types of nodes, depending on their role on the network:

Validator:: The validating nodes execute the consensus algorithm, which in the case of this T Network is the IBFT.

Permissioner:: Are nodes whose physical addresses ("enodes") are perfectly known throughout the network. The network nodes only know the bootnodes that they have in their permitting file. Through a bootnode, the nodes of the network cannot know more nodes.

Regular:: A node that participates by replicating the blockchain, accepting the blocks generated by the validators and executing the transactions included in them. They are also allowed to inject transactions into the Network from sources external to the blockchain.
