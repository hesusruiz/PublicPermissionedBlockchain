  abstract = {The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their O(n 2) message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.},

  url = {https://github.com/dedis/cothority},
  abstract = {Bias-resistant public randomness is a critical component in many (distributed) protocols. Generating public ran-domness is hard, however, because active adversaries may behave dishonestly to bias public random choices toward their advantage. Existing solutions do not scale to hundreds or thousands of participants, as is needed in many decentralized systems. We propose two large-scale distributed protocols, RandHound and RandHerd, which provide publicly-verifiable, unpredictable, and unbiasable randomness against Byzantine adversaries. Rand-Hound relies on an untrusted client to divide a set of randomness servers into groups for scalability, and it depends on the pigeonhole principle to ensure output integrity, even for non-random, adversarial group choices. RandHerd implements an efficient, decentralized randomness beacon. RandHerd is structurally similar to a BFT protocol, but uses RandHound in a one-time setup to arrange participants into verifiably unbiased random secret-sharing groups, which then repeatedly produce random output at predefined intervals. Our prototype demonstrates that RandHound and RandHerd achieve good performance across hundreds of participants while retaining a low failure probability by properly selecting protocol parameters, such as a group size and secret-sharing threshold. For example, when sharding 512 nodes into groups of 32, our experiments show that RandHound can produce fresh random output after 240 seconds. RandHerd, after a setup phase of 260 seconds, is able to generate fresh random output in intervals of approximately 6 seconds. For this configuration, both protocols operate at a failure probability of at most 0.08\% against a Byzantine adversary.},

We present Hawk, a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. AHawk programmer can write a private smart contract in an intuitivemanner without having to implement cryptography, and our compiler automatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties in- teract with the blockchain, using cryptographic primitives such as succint zero-knowledge proofs. To formally define and reason about the security of our protocols, we are the first to formalize the blockchain model of secure computation. The formal modeling is of indepen- dent interest.

However, these techniques jeopardize advantages of the cloud such as elasticity of processing resources. In contrast, we propose decentralized private clouds to allow users to protect their privacy and still benefit from the advantages of cloud computing. Our approach utilizes idle resources of friends and family to realize a trusted, decentralized system in which cloud services can be operated securely and privacy-preserving.

  abstract = {Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the software stack.},

The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor.

The thermal and tribological properties of silicon composites were improved by choosing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a thickener and alumina nitride (AlN) and flake graphite (FG) as thermal conductive additives, producing AlN-modified, FG-modified, and AlN/FG-modified PTFE-based thermal silicon composites (AlN–PTSC, FG–PTSC, and AlN/FG–PTSC, respectively). Three-dimensional network-configuration representative volume element models were built to investigate the thermal properties of these composites by applying a Monte Carlo, controllable, spatial distribution algorithm. The composites' thermal conductivity and volume resistance were also measured. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk reciprocating friction and wear tester. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to analyze the morphologies and elements of worn surfaces. The results showed that AlN/FG–PTSC possessed the best thermal properties, which were ascribed to a compact thermal conductive network; thermal conductivity was 88.8\% and 44.8\% greater than the highest value of AlN–PTSC and FG–PTSC, respectively. The numerical values of thermal conductivity were in a good agreement with experimental results. The optimal electrical tribological properties of AlN/FG–PTSC were ascribed to the functions of thermal and electrical properties combined, which could be helpful in abating the arc erosion on friction contacts. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to " scale-out " – growing total processing capacity with number of participants – and those that do compromise security or decentralization. This work presents OmniLedger, the first scale-out distributed ledger that can preserve long-term security under permissionless operation. OmniLedger ensures strong correctness and security by using a bias-resistant public randomness protocol to choose large statistically representative shards to process trans-actions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit pro-tocol to handle transactions affecting multiple shards atomically. In addition, OmniLedger optimizes performance via scalable intra-shard parallel transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and optional low-latency " trust-but-verify " validation of low-value transactions. Evaluation of our working experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of validators available, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.},

We find that distance continues to be an important deterrent to trade between geographically separated buyers and sell ers, though to a lesser extent than has been observed in studies of non-Internet commerce between business counterparties. We also find a strong uhome bias" for trading with counterparties located in the same city. Further analyses suggest that location-specific goods such as opera tickets, cultural factors, and the possibility of direct contract enforcement in case of breach may be the main reasons behind the same-city bias. (JEL D44, Fll, R12) An extensive literature in international economics analyzes the impact of dis tance on trade flows. Starting with Jan Tinbergen (1962), the stylized finding of a large number of papers estimating the "gravity equation" is that trade volume between two countries increases with the size of their economies and decreases with the distance that separates them. A subset of these papers also reports a significant "border effect." Controlling for distance, trade between two regions is lower if the goods have to cross national borders (John McCallum 1995, and James E. Anderson and Eric van Wincoop 2003). Moreover, when the home bias has been tested for US intranational trade flows, state limits seemed to have an effect on trade similar to that of national borders (Holger C. Wolf 2000, and Russell Hillberry and David L. Hummels 2003). Anderson and van Wincoop (2004), in their recent review of this literature, point out transportation costs and tariffs/taxes as the main frictions contributing to the decline of trade flow with distance and the border effect. They also discuss a growing num ber of papers on "informational frictions." Such informational frictions include search},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of smart devices to collect data and make intelligent decisions. However, a lack of intrinsic security measures makes IoT vulnerable to privacy and security threats. With its “security by design,” Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.},

  abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant state machine replication (BFT) protocols are replication protocols that tolerate arbitrary faults of a fraction of the replicas. Although significant efforts have been recently made, existing BFT protocols do not provide acceptable performance when faults occur. As we show in this paper, this comes from the fact that all existing BFT protocols targeting high throughput use a special replica, called the primary, which indicates to other replicas the order in which requests should be processed. This primary can be smartly malicious and degrade the performance of the system without being detected by correct replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called RBFT for Redundant-BFT: we execute multiple instances of the same BFT protocol, each with a primary replica executing on a different machine. All the instances order the requests, but only the requests ordered by one of the instances, called the master instance, are actually executed. The performance of the different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance. If that is not the case, the primary replica of the master instance is considered malicious and replaced. We implemented RBFT and compared its performance to that of other existing robust protocols. Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3\%, whereas it is at least equal to 78\% for existing protocols.},

However, as their agreement protocols rely on a single leader and make big efforts to establish a global total order on all requests before execution, the performance and scalability of such approaches is limited. To address this problem we present SAREK, a parallel ordering framework that partitions the service state to exploit parallelism during both agreement as well as execution. SAREK utilizes request dependency which is abstracted from application-specific knowledge for the service state partitioning. Instead of having one leader at a time for the entire system, it uses one leader per partition and only establishes an order on requests accessing the same partition. SAREK supports operations that span multiple partitions and provides a deterministic mechanism to atomically process them. To address use cases in which there is not enough application-specific knowledge to always determine a priori which partition(s) a request will operate on, SAREK provides mechanisms to even handle mis-predictions without requiring rollbacks. Our evaluation of a key-value store shows an increase in throughput performance by a factor of 2 at half the latency compared to a single-leader implementation.},

@report{larsenSoKAutomatedSoftware,
  title = {{{SoK}}: {{Automated Software Diversity}}},
  url = {https://www.sba-research.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/sp14b.pdf},
  abstract = {The idea of automatic software diversity is at least two decades old. The deficiencies of currently deployed defenses and the transition to online software distribution (the "App store" model) for traditional and mobile computers has revived the interest in automatic software diversity. Consequently, the literature on diversity grew by more than two dozen papers since 2008. Diversity offers several unique properties. Unlike other defenses , it introduces uncertainty in the target. Precise knowledge of the target software provides the underpinning for a wide range of attacks. This makes diversity a broad rather than narrowly focused defense mechanism. Second, diversity offers probabilistic protection similar to cryptography-attacks may succeed by chance so implementations must offer high entropy. Finally, the design space of diversifying program transformations is large. As a result, researchers have proposed multiple approaches to software diversity that vary with respect to threat models, security, performance, and practicality. In this paper, we systematically study the state-of-the-art in software diversity and highlight fundamental trade-offs between fully automated approaches. We also point to open areas and unresolved challenges. These include "hybrid solutions", error reporting, patching, and implementation disclosure attacks on diversified software. I. MOTIVATION As modern society grows increasingly dependent on the digital domain, adversaries abound in cyberspace. In spite of the combined efforts of the security community, reports of major software vulnerabilities that put millions of users at risk continue to be the norm rather than the exception. Whereas diversity provides protection and resilience in nature, the commoditization of the computer systems has made them increasingly homogeneous with respect to hardware, operating systems, applications, and everything in between. Homogeneity and standardization provide economies of scale, consistent behavior, and simplify the logistics of distributing programs. We therefore live in a software mono-culture. Unfortunately, homogeneity has turned out to be a double-edged sword [26]. An attacker can readily download an identical copy of the commodity software running on their victims' systems and probe it for vulnerabilities. After turning a vulnerability into an exploit, the attacker can target all systems running copies of the vulnerable program. In other words, the software mono-culture creates economies of scale for attackers, too. Artificial software diversity aims to increase the cost to attackers by randomizing implementation aspects of programs. This forces attackers to target each system individually, substantially raising the bar on mass scale exploitation. Without knowledge of the program implementation hosted on a particular system, targeted attacks become significantly harder, too. The idea of protecting programs with artificially generated diversity is at least two decades old [13]. However, compiler-based software diversity has only recently become practical due to the Internet (enabling distribution of individualized software) and cloud computing (computational power to perform diversification) [25]. These developments and the emergence of code-reuse attacks renewed the interest in software diversity. This has led to a large body of research that is in many ways as diverse as the set of program variants they generate. This paper systematizes the understanding of software diversity 1 as follows. First, we show the versatility of artificial software diversity by surveying the range of relevant attacks. Second, we provide the first systematic and unified overview of existing diversification approaches. In particular, we characterize the four major properties of a diversification approach using a consistent terminology: (i) what is diversified (Section III), (ii) when and where diversification happens (Section IV), (iii) how security is evaluated (Section V-A), and (iv) the resulting performance overheads (Section V-B). Finally, we point to open areas of research and challenge the belief that compiler-based diversification is less versatile than binary rewriting (Section VI). II. TODAY'S SECURITY LANDSCAPE Attackers and defenders in cyberspace engage in a continuous arms race. As new attacks appear, new defenses are created in response-leading to increased complexity in both cases. To motivate a study of software diversity, we briefly summarize the evolution and current state of computer security. A. Taxonomy of Attacks There is a large spectrum of attacks that an attacker can use against a target, employing a wide range of low-level techniques. We present the ones that are most relevant to automated software diversity. 1) Information Leaks: Often, the attacker seeks to read some sensitive program state he should not have access to. This includes contents of processor registers, memory pages, process meta-data, files, etc. Such information can be valuable to an attacker by itself (e.g., credit card numbers, login credentials, or other personal user information) or to further an ongoing attack (by locating protected objects in memory through a pointer leak, or by reading encryption keys used to encrypt other data). In general, information leaks are increasingly used to overcome situations where attackers lack knowledge of program internals [60], [9]. For example, information leaks help bypass address space layout randomization in later stages of an attack. 1 Research on multi-variant systems overlaps with software diversity. Diversity can be studied in isolation, however. We do so due to space restrictions.},

Considering an asynchronous message-passing system of n processes where (a) up to t \textbackslash{}textless n/3 may commit Byzantine failures, and (b) each pair of processes is connected by two uni-directional channels (with possibly different timing properties), this paper investigates the synchrony assumption required to solve consensus, and presents a signature-free consensus algorithm whose synchrony requirement is the existence of a process that is an eventual t + 1bisource. Such a process p is a correct process that eventually has (a) timely input channels from t correct processes and (b) timely output channels to t correct processes (these input and output channels can connect p to different subsets of processes). As this synchrony condition was shown to be necessary and sufficient in the stronger asynchronous system model (a) enriched with message authentication, and (b) where the channels are bidirectional and have the same timing properties in both directions, it follows that it is also necessary and sufficient in the weaker system model considered in the paper. In addition to the fact that it closes a long-lasting problem related to Byzantine agreement, a noteworthy feature of the proposed algorithm lies in its design simplicity, which is a first-class property.},

Instead, they optimistically adopt the order proposed by the primary and respond immediately to the client.

More specifically, we show that an adversary can exploit these measures in order to effectively delay the propagation of transactions and blocks to specific nodes-without causing a network partitioning in the system. We show that this allows the adversary to easily mount Denial-of-Service attacks, considerably increase its mining advantage in the network, and double-spend transactions in spite of the current countermeasures adopted by Bitcoin.

Software bugs, operator mistakes, and malicious attacks are a major cause of service interruptions and they can cause arbitrary behavior , that is, Byzantine faults. This article describes a new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to build highly available systems that tolerate Byzantine faults. BFT can be used in practice to implement real services: it performs well, it is safe in asynchronous environments such as the Internet, it incorporates mechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and it recovers replicas proactively. The recovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become faulty within a small window of vulnerability. BFT has been implemented as a generic program library with a simple interface. We used the library to implement the first Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT library and BFS perform well because the library incorporates several important optimizations, the most important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to authenticate messages. The performance results show that BFS performs 2\% faster to 24\% slower than production implementations of the NFS protocol that are not replicated. This supports our claim that the BFT library can be used to build practical systems that tolerate Byzantine faults.},

This primitive admits an efficient and simple implementation by the composition of Eppstein's set reconciliation protocol with Ben-Or's ByzConsensus protocol. A free software implementation of this construction is available in GNUnet. Experimental results indicate that our approach results in an efficient protocol for very large sets, especially in the absence of Byzantine faults. We show the versatility of set-union consensus by using it to implement distributed key generation, ballot collection, and cooperative decryption for an electronic voting protocol implemented in GNUnet.

Our approach executes a request on only a selected subset of replicas, using a selector component co-located with each replica. As this leads to divergent replica states, a selector on-demand updates outdated objects on the local replica prior to processing a request. Our evaluation shows that with each replica executing only a part of all requests, the overall performance of a Byzantine fault-tolerant NFS can be almost doubled; our prototype even outperforms unreplicated NFS.},

A Crutial information switch protects each LAN (see Figure 1). A CIS provides two basic services: The protection service ensures that the incoming and outgoing traffic from the LAN satisfies the security policy of the organization managing the LAN. The communication service supports secure communication between the CIS and, ultimately, between LANs. It provides secure channels and multicast between CISs. In this article, we focus on the protection service. A CIS is a distributed protection device with the following main characteristics: It resembles a distributed firewall 3 because organizations • • • can deploy it not only at the network border but also inside the network to protect critical equipment. It uses a rich access-control model that considers the involvement of different organizations and lets the access control rules depend on context information. 4 It's intrusion-tolerant 5-that is, it operates correctly even if an attacker intrudes in some of its components. Its objective is to withstand a high degree of hostility from the environment. Researchers have proposed other intrusion-tolerant services (a brief survey is available elsewhere 6); however , the CIS design differs from those services in two essential ways. First, a firewall-like component has to be transparent to the protocols that pass through it, so it cannot modify these protocols to obtain intrusion tolerance. Second, internal CIS intrusion-tolerance mechanisms must be transparent to recipient nodes, because such nodes can't protect themselves from malicious messages forwarded by faulty CIS components not satisfying the security policy. • • C ritical infrastructure protection is harder to address than information and communication technology (ICT) protection because of these infrastructures' interconnection complexity, which can lead to various kinds of problems. Consider the power grid, in which geographically dispersed production sites distribute power through different voltage level stations (from higher to lower voltage) until energy eventually flows into our houses. Both the production and distribution sites are typically controlled by supervisory control and data-acquisition (SCada) systems, which are remotely connected to supervision centers and to the corporate networks (intranets) of the companies managing the infrastructures. The intranets are linked to the Internet to facilitate, for example, communication with power regulators and end clients. These links create a path for external attackers. Operators access SCada systems remotely for maintenance operations, and sometimes equipment suppliers keep links to the systems through modems. From the viewpoint of keeping the system working, this is all a good idea, but from a security perspective, this looks like a recipe for serious problems. 1 This conclusion is far from speculation: a few years ago, an Internet worm entered a nuclear plant's supervision systems through a supplier's modem, which almost caused a disaster. 2 On a more positive side, critical infrastructure companies and governments have been showing a high level of concern about this state of affairs, and have been pushing several security measures. However, a careful reading of the legion of guidelines being produced (for example, US National Institute of Standards and Technology specification 800-82 3) shows a common trend that we can summarize in a couple of ideas: critical infrastructure protection is a network security problem that should be handled using secure communication protocols and perimeter protection through firewalls. These mechanisms are a first level of protection with undeniable utility and importance. However, they put critical infrastructure protection at the level of ICT security, which is inadequate because of these infrastructures' criticality and societal relevance. Moreover, firewalls are known to be vulnerable to intrusions and denial-of-service attacks. The US National Vulnerability database reported 9 vulnerabilities that might lead to intrusions in commercial firewalls in 2005, 15 in 2006, and again 15 in 2007. The total number of vulnerabilities reported for these three years is 79. We clearly need more than classical prevention security mechanisms such as firewalls. However, when building new solutions, developers must recognize that critical infrastructures feature numerous legacy subsystems and noncomputational components, such as controllers , sensors, and actuators, which can't be modified for operational reasons or others, for several years to come. In addition, a company's main concern is keeping its critical infrastructure working at the expected level of service. Security mechanisms that stand in the way of operation are unacceptable.},

In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that combines proactive recovery with services that allow correct replicas to react and recover replicas that they detect or suspect to be compromised. One key feature of our proactive-reactive recovery approach is that, despite recoveries , it guarantees the availability of the minimum amount of system replicas necessary to sustain system's correct operation. We design a proactive-reactive recovery service based on a hybrid distributed system model and show, as a case study, how this service can effectively be used to augment the resilience of an intrusion-tolerant firewall adequate for the protection of critical infrastructures.},

  abstract = {We describe a new architecture for Byzantine fault tolerant state machine replication that separates agreement that orders requests from execution that processes requests. This separation yields two fundamental and practically significant advantages over previous architectures. First, it reduces replication costs because the new architecture can tolerate faults in up to half of the state machine replicas that execute requests. Previous systems can tolerate faults in at most a third of the combined agreement/state machine replicas. Second, separating agreement from execution allows a general privacy firewall architecture to protect confidentiality through replication. In contrast, replication in previous systems hurts confidentiality because exploiting the weakest replica can be sufficient to compromise the system. We have constructed a prototype and evaluated it running both microbenchmarks and an NFS server. Overall, we find that the architecture adds modest latencies to unreplicated systems and that its performance is competitive with existing Byzantine fault tolerant systems.},

  title = {Authentication as a Service: {{Shamir Secret Sharing}} with Byzantine Components},
  abstract = {We present a practical methodology for securing the classical password-based authentication scheme, since in many cases this type of authenti-cation is given as a requirement. We propose a solution based on the well-known (k, n) threshold scheme of Shamir for sharing a secret, where in our case the secret is the password itself and (k, n) threshold scheme means that n password-derived secrets (shares) are created and k ≤ n shares are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing the password, while k − 1 are not sufficient. The scheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on a different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different shareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the secret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server (dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic Shamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders, making the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and shareholders compromised. In addition we use the Pedersen technique for allowing the verification of shares. For the described scenario we have designed two protocols allowing the communication between application, dealer and shareholders, so that the relevant players can participate to the phases of registration (user's sign-up, to be carried out once), and of authentication (user's login). We analyse several scenarios where dealer and/or shareholders are par-tially/totally compromised and confirm that none of them is enabling the attacker to break the authentication. Furthermore we focus on cases where one or more byzantine servers are presented, analysing the impact on the framework and show the adopted mechanisms to be safe against these kinds of attacks. We have developed a prototype demonstrating that our framework works correctly, effectively and efficiently. It provides a first feasibility study that will provide a base for structured and engineered cloud-based implementations aiming at providing an authentication-as-a-service.},

  abstract = {Conceptually, tuple spaces are shared memory objects that provide operations to store and retrieve ordered sets of data, called tuples. Tuples stored in a tuple space are accessed by the contents of their fields, working as an associative memory. Although there are some proposals for secure tuple spaces, accessing tuples through field contents makes these systems susceptible to attacks that could impair user and data privacy, since servers must access tuple data. In order to deal with these limitations and provide privacy in the tuple space model, this paper proposes some extensions to DepSpace, a tuple space system that implements dependability and security properties through a set of mechanisms that are not enough to ensure privacy. The resulting system provides privacy and, at the same time, allows tuple selection/matches similar to the traditional insecure model, i.e., it does not constraint the matching possibilities. The main problem to be addressed is that servers must select tuples based on their contents without knowing them. The proposed solution uses robust cryptographic schemes, as order-preserving encryption and homomorphic encryption, to provide this functionality without revealing the tuple contents. An analysis concerning security aspects of DepSpace is presented, as well as the benefits of the proposed solutions. A set of experiments, executed with an implementation of the proposed protocols, shows the feasibility of the proposed solutions and shed some light on both the behavior of the system and the costs to provide privacy in the tuple spaces model.},

The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work.

  abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound A on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound \% on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @ exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cp exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds A and Cp. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.

Compared with bitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are more applicable for consortium blockchain.

The hybrid fault model with Trusted Components (TC) assistance is proposed to reduce the minimum to 2f + 1 and improve overall performance. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic principles of BFT algorithms based on the hybrid fault model. Then we analyze different TC abstractions and implementation scenarios, and express our own choices. The general framework for BFT algorithms design choices and the applications of this model in blockchain are also discussed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide guidance for reasonable design of efficient BFT algorithms and application of TC assistance mechanism.},

  abstract = {Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, are nodes which only download a small portion of the data in a blockchain, and use indirect means to verify that a given chain is valid. Typically, instead of validating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's consensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block producers are honest. By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs generated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the protocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to verify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded, we can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker assumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data. Fraud and data availability proofs are key to enabling on-chain scaling of blockchains (e.g. via sharding or bigger blocks) while maintaining a strong assurance that on-chain data is available and valid. We present, implement, and evaluate a novel fraud and data availability proof system.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new resilience optimal Byzantine consensus algorithm targeting consortium blockchains. To this end, it first revisits the consensus validity property by requiring that the decided value satisfies a predefined predicate, which does not systematically exclude a value proposed only by Byzantine processes, thereby generalizing the validity properties found in the literature. Then the paper presents a simple and modular Byzantine consensus algorithm that relies neither on a leader, nor on signatures, nor on randomization. It consists of a reduction of multivalued Byzantine consensus to binary Byzantine consensus satisfying this validity property. This reduction terminates after a constant-sized sequence of binary Byzantine consensus instances. The idea is to spawn concurrent instances of binary consensus but to decide only after a sequence of two of these instances. The binary consensus instances result in a bitmask that the reduction applies to a vector of multivalued proposals to filter out a valid proposed value that is decided. The paper then presents an underlying binary Byzantine consensus algorithm that assumes eventual synchrony to terminate.},

  abstract = {Despite the hype about blockchains and distributed ledgers, no formal abstraction of these objects has been proposed. To face this issue, in this paper we provide a proper formulation of a distributed ledger object. In brief, we define a ledger object as a sequence of records, and we provide the operations and the properties that such an object should support. Implementation of a ledger object on top of multiple (possibly geographically dispersed) computing devices gives rise to the distributed ledger object. In contrast to the centralized object, distribution allows operations to be applied concurrently on the ledger, introducing challenges on the consistency of the ledger in each participant. We provide the definitions of three well known consistency guarantees in terms of the operations supported by the ledger object: (1) atomic consistency (linearizability), (2) sequential consistency, and (3) eventual consistency. We then provide implementations of distributed ledgers on asynchronous message passing crash-prone systems using an Atomic Broadcast service, and show that they provide eventual, sequential or atomic consistency semantics. We conclude with a variation of the ledger - the validated ledger - which requires that each record in the ledger satisfies a particular validation rule.},

PeerReview ensures that Byzantine faults whose effects are observed by a correct node are eventually detected and irrefutably linked to a faulty node. At the same time, PeerReview ensures that a correct node can always defend itself against false accusations. These guarantees are particularly important for systems that span multiple administrative domains, which may not trust each other. PeerReview works by maintaining a secure record of the messages sent and received by each node. The record is used to automatically detect when a node's behavior deviates from that of a given reference implementation, thus exposing faulty nodes. PeerReview is widely applicable: it only requires that a correct node's actions are deterministic, that nodes can sign messages, and that each node is periodically checked by a correct node. We demonstrate that Peer-Review is practical by applying it to three different types of distributed systems: a network filesystem, a peer-to-peer system, and an overlay multicast system.},

This work studies the problem of Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus with Unknown Participants, namely BFT-CUP. This new problem aims at solving consensus in unknown networks with the additional requirement that participants in the system may behave maliciously. It presents the necessary and sufficient knowledge connectivity conditions in order to solve BFT-CUP under minimal synchrony requirements.

Today a variety of solution to this problem exist, each optimized for particular execution conditions. Given that, in most cases, real systems operate under dynamic conditions, it is important to develop mechanisms that allow the algorithms to be adapted or changed at runtime to optimize the system to the current conditions. The problem of dynamic adaptation of consensus algorithms is not new, but the literature is scarce for the Byzantine case and there is no comprehensive comparison of existing solutions. This work has two complementary objectives. First, it studies how the different dynamic adaptation techniques proposed for the crash failure model can be applied in the presence of Byzantine faults. Second, it presents a comparative study of the performance of these switching algorithms in practice. For that purpose, we have implemented the switching algorithms in a common software framework, based on the open source BFT-SMaRt library. Using this framework we have performed an extensive evaluation that offers useful insights on the practical effects of different mechanisms used to support the run-time switching among Byzantine protocols.

Existing network-based intrusion detection sensors can barely keep up with bandwidths of a few hundred Mbps.

We propose a partitioning approach to network security analysis that supports in-depth, stateful intrusion detection on high-speed links. The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network traffic into subsets of manageable size. The traffic partitioning is done so that a single slice contains all the evidence necessary to detect a specific attack, making sensor-to-sensor interactions unnecessary. This paper describes the approach and presents a first experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.},

Parties involved in the transaction maintain a multi-signature fraud-proof off-chain replicated state machine, and only resort to on-chain consensus when absolutely necessary (e.g., when two parties disagree on a state). Off-chain scaling is the only way to support fully scale-out decentralized applications ("dApps") with better privacy and no compromise on the trust and decentralization guarantees. It is the inflection point for blockchain mass adoption, and will be the engine behind all scalable dApps. Celer Network is an Internet-scale, trust-free, and privacy-preserving platform where everyone can quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable dApps. It is not a standalone blockchain but a networked system running on top of existing and future blockchains. It provides unprecedented performance and flexibility through innovation in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics. Celer Network embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including a generalized state channel and sidechain suite that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal value transfer routing mechanism that achieves an order of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain applications; and a new cryptoeconomic model that provides network effect, stable liquidity, and high availability for the off-chain ecosystem.},

Our case study of a DAO illustrates that governance in the blockchain economy might radically depart from established notions of governance. Using the three governance dimensions, we propose a novel IT governance framework and a research agenda for governance in the blockchain economy.

Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs currently used to implement Confidential Transactions (CT) in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie within a given range by providing only an additive Oplogpmqq group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup.

  abstract = {Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence, values and histories of the states. As the technology landscape is expanding rapidly, it is both important and challenging to have a firm grasp of what the core technologies have to offer, especially with respect to their data processing capabilities. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems. Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has the potential to radically alter the way enterprises conduct business as well as the way institutions process transactions. Businesses and governments often operate in isolation but with blockchain technology participants can engage in business transactions with customers, suppliers, regulators, potentially spanning across geographical boundaries. Blockchain technology, at its core, features an immutable distributed ledger, a decentralized network that is cryptographically secured. Blockchain architecture gives participants the ability to share a ledger, through peer to peer replication, which is updated every time a block of transaction(s) is agreed to be committed. The technology can reduce operational costs and friction, create transaction records that are immutable, and enable transparent ledgers where updates are nearly instantaneous. It may also dramatically change the way workflow and business procedures are designed inside an enterprise and open up new opportunities for innovation and growth. Blockchain technology can be viewed from a business, legal and technical perspective: • From a business perspective, blockchain is an exchange network that facilitates transfer of value, assets, or other entities between willing and mutually agreeing participants, ensuring privacy and control of data to stakeholders • From a legal perspective, blockchain ledger transactions are validated, indisputable transactions, which do not require intermediaries or trusted third-party legal entities. • From a technical perspective, blockchain is a replicated, distributed ledger of transactions with ledger entries referencing other data stores (for additional information related to ledger transactions). Cryptography is used to ensure that network participants see only the parts of the ledger that are relevant to them, and that transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable, in the context of permissioned business blockchains. This document will introduce basic blockchain concepts that define a standard reference architecture that can be used in creating blockchain applications. Blockchain Fundamentals A blockchain is a shared ledger distributed across a business network. Business transactions are permanently recorded in append-only blocks to the ledger. All the consensually confirmed and validated transaction blocks are linked from the genesis block to the most current block with each block linked to its previous block using the cryptographic hash of the previous block -hence the name blockchain.},

Bitcoin uses this technology to provide a provenance-driven verifiable ledger that is based on consensus. Nevertheless, the use of blockchain as a transaction service in non-cryptocurrency applications, for example, business networks, is at a very nascent stage. While the blockchain supports transactional provenance, the data management community and other scientific and industrial communities are assessing how blockchain can be used to enable certain key capabilities for business applications. We have reviewed a number of proof of concepts and early adoptions of blockchain solutions that we have been involved spanning diverse use cases to draw common data life cycle, persis- tence as well as analytics patterns used in real-world applications with the ultimate aim to identify new frontier of exciting re- search in blockchain data management and analytics. In this paper, we discuss several open topics that researchers could in- crease focus on: (1) leverage existing capabilities of mature data and information systems, (2) enhance data security and privacy assurances, (3) enable analytics services on blockchain as well as across off-chain data, and (4) make blockchain-based systems active-oriented and intelligent.},

  abstract = {Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and 250 similar alt-coins, embody at their core a blockchain protocol-a mechanism for a distributed network of computational nodes to periodically agree on a set of new transactions. Designing a secure blockchain protocol relies on an open challenge in security, that of designing a highly-scalable agreement protocol open to manipulation by byzantine or arbitrarily malicious nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain agreement protocol exhibits security, but does not scale: it processes 3-7 transactions per second at present, irrespective of the available computation capacity at hand. In this paper, we propose a new distributed agreement protocol for permission-less blockchains called ELASTICO. ELASTICO scales transaction rates almost linearly with available computation for mining: the more the computation power in the network, the higher the number of transaction blocks selected per unit time. ELASTICO is efficient in its network messages and tolerates byzan-tine adversaries of up to one-fourth of the total computational power. Technically, ELASTICO uniformly partitions or parallelizes the mining network (securely) into smaller committees, each of which processes a disjoint set of transactions (or "shards"). While sharding is common in non-byzantine settings, ELASTICO is the first candidate for a secure sharding protocol with presence of byzantine adversaries. Our scalability experiments on Amazon EC2 with up to 1, 600 nodes confirm ELASTICO's theoretical scaling properties.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study fault-tolerant distributed consensus in wireless systems. In more detail, we produce two new randomized algorithms that solve this problem in the abstract MAC layer model, which captures the basic interface and communication guarantees provided by most wireless MAC layers. Our algorithms work for any number of failures, require no advance knowledge of the network participants or network size, and guarantee termination with high probability after a number of broadcasts that are polynomial in the network size. Our first algorithm satisfies the standard agreement property, while our second trades a faster termination guarantee in exchange for a looser agreement property in which most nodes agree on the same value. These are the first known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms for this model. In addition to our main upper bound results, we explore the gap between the abstract MAC layer and the standard asynchronous message passing model by proving fault-tolerant consensus is impossible in the latter in the absence of information regarding the network participants, even if we assume no faults, allow randomized solutions, and provide the algorithm a constant-factor approximation of the network size.},

Distributed transactions are often rejected as an undesirable tradeoff today, but in the absence of transactions there are few concrete principles or tools to help programmers design and verify the correctness of their applications. We address this situation with the CALM principle, which con- nects the idea of distributed consistency to program tests for logical monotonicity. We then introduce Bloom, a distributed programming language that is amenable to high-level consistency analysis and encourages order-insensitive programming. We present a prototype implementation of Bloom as a domain-specific language in Ruby. We also propose a program analysis technique that identifies points of order in Bloom programs: code locations where programmers may need to inject coordination logic to ensure consistency. We illustrate these ideas with two case studies: a simple key-value store and a distributed shopping cart service.},

To reduce cost, we incorporate on-demand instantiation, which activates a subset of replicas first and activates backup ones when active ones fail. To solve its key limitation—the system can be halted for long when activating a backup replica, we apply lazy recovery, al- lowing the system to proceed while recovering backup nodes in the background. The key contribution of this paper is to identify that, when agreement nodes and exe- cution nodes are logically separated, they each presents a unique property that enables lazy recovery. We have ap- plied this idea to Paxos and built ThriftyPaxos, which, as shown in the evaluation, can achieve higher throughput and similar availability comparing to standard Paxos, de- spite the fact that ThriftyPaxos activates fewer replicas.},

A variety of consensus algorithms for such blockchains have been proposed, each of which has different benefits and drawbacks. Proof-of-Authority (PoA) is a new family of Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms largely used in practice to ensure better performance than traditional Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). However, the lack of adequate analysis of PoA hinders any cautious evaluation of their effectiveness in real-world permissioned blockchains deployed over the Internet, hence on an eventually synchronous network experimenting Byzantine nodes. In this paper, we analyse two of the main PoA algorithms, named Aura and Clique, both in terms of provided guarantees and performances. First, we derive their functioning including how messages are exchanged, then we weight, by relying on the CAP theorem, consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. We also report a qualitative latency analysis based on message rounds. The analysis advocates that PoA for permissioned blockchains, deployed over the Internet with Byzantine nodes, do not provide adequate consistency guarantees for scenarios where data integrity is essential. We claim that PBFT can fit better such scenarios, despite a limited loss in terms of performance.},

While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, new consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result, it is often unclear whether the same systems could be adapted to work in different environments. In this position paper, we explore the use of the Ethereum blockchain protocol in the context of a private chain where the set of participants is controlled. We argue that foundations are needed in order to precisely capture the guarantees of the consensus protocols of novel blockchain systems before one can deploy them safely. To this end, we define the termination of consensus to characterize when blockchain transactions commit and describe the existence of the Blockchain Anomaly in existing proof-of-work private chains.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the consensus problem in asynchronous systems prone to process crashes, where additionally the processes are anonymous (they cannot be distinguished one from the other: they have no name and execute the same code). To circumvent the three computational adversaries (asynchrony, failures and anonymity) each process is provided with a failure detector ofa class denoted ψ, that gives it an upper bound on the number of processes that are currently alive (in a non-anonymous system, the classes ψ and P -the class of perfect failure detectors- are equivalent). The paper first presents a simple ψ-based consensus algorithm where the processes decide in 2t + 1 asynchronous rounds (where t is an upper bound on the number of faulty processes). It then shows one of its main results, namely, 2t + 1 is a lower bound for consensus in the anonymous systems equipped with ψ. The second contribution addresses early-decision. The paper presents and proves correct an early-deciding algorithm where the processes decide in min(2f + 2, 2t + 1) asynchronous rounds (where f is the actual number of process failures). This leads to think that anonymity doubles the cost (wrt synchronous systems) and it is conjectured that min(2f + 2, 2t + 1) is the corresponding lower bound. The paper finally considers the k-set agreement problem in anonymous systems. It first shows that the previous ψ-based consensus algorithm solves the k-set agreement problem in Rt = 2? t k ? +1 asynchronous rounds. Then, considering a family offailure detector classes \{ψ?\}1≤?≤k that generalizes the class ψ(= ψ1), the paper presents an algorithm that solves the k-set agreement in Rt,? = 2? t k−?+1?+1 asynchronous rounds. This last formula relates the cost (Rt,?), the coordination degree of the problem (k), the maximum number of failures (t) and the the strength (?) of the underlying failure detector. Finally the paper concludes by presenting},

  abstract = {Service replication distributes an application over many processes for tolerating faults, attacks, and misbehavior among a subset of the processes. The established state-machine replication paradigm inherently requires the application to be deterministic. This paper distinguishes three models for dealing with non-determinism in replicated services, where some processes are subject to faults and arbitrary behavior (so-called Byzantine faults): first, a modular approach that does not require any changes to the potentially non-deterministic application (and neither access to its internal data); second, a master-slave approach, in which ties are broken by a leader and the other processes validate the choices of the leader; and finally, a treatment of applications that use cryptography and secret keys. Cryptographic operations and secrets must be treated specially because they require strong randomness to satisfy their goals. The paper also introduces two new protocols. The first uses the modular approach for filtering out non-de\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$-ter\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$-min\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$-istic operations in an application. It ensures that all correct processes produce the same outputs and that their internal states do not diverge. The second protocol implements cryptographically secure randomness generation with a verifiable random function and is appropriate for certain security models. All protocols are described in a generic way and do not assume a particular implementation of the underlying consensus primitive.},

  abstract = {The blockchain initially gained traction in 2008 as the technology underlying bitcoin, but now has been employed in a diverse range of applications and created a global market worth over \$150B as of 2017. What distinguishes blockchains from traditional distributed databases is the ability to operate in a decentralized setting without relying on a trusted third party. As such their core technical component is consensus: how to reach agreement among a group of nodes. This has been extensively studied already in the distributed systems community for closed systems, but its application to open blockchains has revitalized the field and led to a plethora of new designs. The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols, we describe: first protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW), second proof-of-X (PoX) protocols that replace PoW with more energy-efficient alternatives, and third hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. We develop a framework to evaluate their performance, security and design properties, and use it to systematize key themes in the protocol categories described above. This evaluation leads us to identify research gaps and challenges for the community to consider in future research endeavours.},

We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and de-velop a model that captures incentives for verifying com-putation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain ap-plications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify.

  doi = {10.1016/j.future.2017.09.023},
  abstract = {Consensus is a fundamental problem of distributed computing. While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues.In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains.},

Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guar-antees liveness without making any timing assumptions.

We study how the notion of smart contract is interpreted in some of these platforms.

Nonetheless, the version 1.0 was launched in early 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine replication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different continents.},

All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3∼Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.},

BC has the potential to overcome security and privacy challenges of Internet of Things (IoT). However, BC is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited to the IoT context. We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a smart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for communication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several optimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed trust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB decreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to relevant baselines.},

They are notoriously difficult to develop, test and prove. We present a new abstraction to simplify these tasks. We treat a BFT protocol as a composition of instances of our abstraction. Each instance is developed and analyzed independently. To illustrate our approach, we first show how our abstraction can be used to obtain the benefits of a state-of-the-art BFT protocol with much less pain. Namely, we develop AZyzzyva, a new protocol that mimics the behavior of Zyzzyva in best-case situations (for which Zyzzyva was optimized) using less than 24\% of the actual code of Zyzzyva. To cover worst-case situations, our abstraction enables to use in AZyzzyva any existing BFT protocol, typically, a classical one like PBFT which has been tested and proved correct. We then present Aliph, a new BFT protocol that outperforms previous BFT protocols both in terms of latency (by up to 30\%) and throughput (by up to 360\%). The development of Aliph required two new instances of our abstraction. Each instance contains less than 25\% of the code needed to develop state-of-the-art BFT protocols.},

  abstract = {Bitcoin cryptocurrency demonstrated the utility of global consensus across thousands of nodes, changing the world of digital transactions forever. In the early days of Bitcoin, the performance of its probabilistic proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus fabric, also known as blockchain, was not a major issue. Bitcoin became a success story, despite its consensus latencies on the order of an hour and the theoretical peak throughput of only up to 7 transactions per second. The situation today is radically different and the poor performance scal-ability of early PoW blockchains no longer makes sense. Specifically, the trend of modern cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, is to support execution of arbitrary distributed applications on blockchain fabric , needing much better performance. This approach, however, makes cryptocurrency platforms step away from their original purpose and enter the domain of database-replication protocols, notably, the classical state-machine replication, and in particular its Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) variants. In this paper, we contrast PoW-based blockchains to those based on BFT state machine replication, focusing on their scalability limits. We also discuss recent proposals to overcoming these scalability limits and outline key outstanding open problems in the quest for the "ultimate" blockchain fabric(s).},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05831},
  abstract = {Despite years of intensive research, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems have not yet been adopted in practice. This is due to additional cost of BFT in terms of resources, protocol complexity and performance, compared with crash fault-tolerance (CFT). This overhead of BFT comes from the assumption of a powerful adversary that can fully control not only the Byzantine faulty machines, but at the same time also the message delivery schedule across the entire network, effectively inducing communication asynchrony and partitioning otherwise correct machines at will. To many practitioners, however, such strong attacks appear irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce cross fault tolerance or XFT, a novel approach to building reliable and secure distributed systems and apply it to the classical state-machine replication (SMR) problem. In short, an XFT SMR protocol provides the reliability guarantees of widely used asynchronous CFT SMR protocols such as Paxos and Raft, but also tolerates Byzantine faults in combination with network asynchrony, as long as a majority of replicas are correct and communicate synchronously. This allows the development of XFT systems at the price of CFT (already paid for in practice), yet with strictly stronger resilience than CFT — sometimes even stronger than BFT itself. As a showcase for XFT, we present XPaxos, the first XFT SMR protocol, and deploy it in a geo-replicated setting. Although it offers much stronger resilience than CFT SMR at no extra resource cost, the performance of XPaxos matches that of the state-of-the-art CFT protocols.},

Insufficient investments in the security needs of these and other price-sensitive devices have left consumers and society critically exposed to device security and privacy failures.

Second, we describe our experiment working with a silicon partner to revise one of their microcontrollers to create a prototype, highly secure microcontroller. Our experimental results suggest that in the near future even the most price-sensitive devices should be redesigned to achieve the high levels of device security critical to society's safety.

  url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08541},
  abstract = {A smart contract on a blockchain cannot keep a secret because its data is replicated on all nodes in a network. To remedy this problem, it has been suggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. As a consequence untrusted blockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE. This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of TEEs with blockchains. Since smart contracts executed inside TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are susceptible to roll-back attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy for the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus protocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract execution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing blockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this approach works only when the consensus decisions are final. Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for smart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hy-perledger Fabric, a prominent enterprise blockchain platform. Our system resolves difficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric, prevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible, and minimizes the trusted computing base. For increasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain within its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation shows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10\%-20\% for a sealed-bid auction application.},

  abstract = {Modern IoT deployments do require considerable investments that might only be justified if the data being gathered could be monetized, which leads to the need for a digital data marketplace. In many cases, the provider of the IoT data needs to process it locally for data curation, aggregation, stream processing, etc. At the same time, the consumer could be interested in nearby data. This scenario resembles a fog computing architecture where companies require being able, keeping data under their control, to securely make it available to other companies in a peer-to-peer fashion, without needing a cloud intermediary (like traditional marketplaces do), thus maximizing the locality of the processing and avoiding the existence of a bottleneck when the intermediary makes the data delivery for accounting purposes. Nevertheless, this imposes a hard requirement: by not having a central marketplace, the peers (seller and customer) need to trust each other, which, in turn, requires enforcing a nonrepudiation schema. In this paper, the authors propose a distributed peer-to-peer architecture for such a data marketplace that takes advantage of the architectural fundamentals of fog computing, in which data processing, filtering, and stream based event generation is done in a fog node along with the data, and where relationships, both commercial agreements and data delivery, are performed directly between producers and consumers without the need of mutual trust thanks to the usage of blockchain principles (e.g., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism). The proposed architecture is validated through a case study involving a set of key issues regarding nonrepudiation commonly identified when moving from a centralized marketplace to a distributed one. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed solution does not bring in any limitation with regard to a centralized marketplace solution, in terms of pricing models (subscriptions, pay-per-use, etc.) or usage conditions (contract duration, updates rate, etc.).},

  abstract = {Recent research works have shown that applying parallelization to request processing in Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) can bring signiﬁcant performance improvement. Based on partitioned service state, parallelism is introduced to both agreement and execution to address performance and scalability limitations caused by the global total order of all requests. However, in case of inefﬁcient state partitioning, expensive synchronization among partitions is expected, which leads to a considerable performance loss. To improve the efﬁciency of parallel processing, we present Dynamic State Partitioning (DYPART), a framework that maps service state into multiple partitions and periodically reconﬁgures the partitions for different usage patterns. DYPART relies on the knowledge about relations between the state objects for partitioning, which is obtained by collecting request dependencies. It utilizes a highperformance graph partitioning algorithm to ensure that the resulting state partitions can achieve both workload balance and low synchronization among partitions. Our evaluation of a key-value store shows that compared to a random partitioning, DYPART can improve the performance by at least 40\%.},

  abstract = {Existing proof-of-work cryptocurrencies cannot tolerate attackers controlling more than 50\% of the network’s computing power at any time, but assume that such a condition happening is “unlikely”. However, recent attack sophistication, e.g., where attackers can rent mining capacity to obtain a majority of computing power temporarily, render this assumption unrealistic. This paper proposes RepuCoin, the first system to provide guarantees even when more than 50\% of the system’s computing power is temporarily dominated by an attacker. RepuCoin physically limits the rate of voting power growth of the entire system. In particular, RepuCoin defines a miner’s power by its ‘reputation’, as a function of its work integrated over the time of the entire blockchain, rather than through instantaneous computing power, which can be obtained relatively quickly and/or temporarily. As an example, after a single year of operation, RepuCoin can tolerate attacks compromising 51\% of the network’s computing resources, even if such power stays maliciously seized for almost a whole year. Moreover, RepuCoin provides better resilience to known attacks, compared to existing proof-of-work systems, while achieving a high throughput of 10000 transactions per second (TPS).},

Consequently, faulttolerance in CPS becomes a challenging task, especially when accounting for failures (potentially malicious) that incapacitate the gateway or disrupt the nodes-gateway communication, not to mention the energy, timeliness, and security constraints demanded by CPS domains. This paper aims at ameliorating the fault-tolerance of WSN based CPS to increase system and data availability. To this end, we propose a replicated gateway architecture augmented with energy-efﬁcient real-time Byzantineresilient data communication protocols. At the sensors level, we introduce FT-TSTP, a geographic routing protocol capable of delivering messages in an energy-efﬁcient and timely manner to multiple gateways, even in the presence of voids caused by faulty and malicious sensor nodes. At the gateway level, we propose a multi-gateway synchronization protocol, which we call ByzCast, that delivers timely correct data to CPS applications, despite the failure or maliciousness of a number of gateways. We show, through extensive simulations, that our protocols provide better system robustness yielding an increased system and data availability while meeting CPS energy, timeliness, and security demands.},

  abstract = {Safety-critical real-time systems, including real-time cyber-physical and industrial control systems, need not be solely correct but also timely. Untimely (stale) results may have severe consequences that could render the control system’s behaviour hazardous to the physical world. To ensure predictability and timeliness, developers follow a rigorous process, which essentially ensures real-time properties a priori, in all but the most unlikely combinations of circumstances. However, we have seen the complexity of both real-time applications, and the environments they run on, increase. If this is matched with the also increasing sophistication of attacks mounted to RTES systems, the case for ensuring both safety and security through aprioristic predictability loses traction, and presents an opportunity, which we take in this paper, for discussing current practices of critical realtime system design. To this end, with a slant on low-level task scheduling, we ﬁrst investigate the challenges and opportunities for anticipating successful attacks on real-time systems. Then, we propose ways for adapting traditional fault- and intrusiontolerant mechanisms to tolerate such hazards. We found that tasks which typically execute as analyzed under accidental faults, may exhibit fundamentally different behavior when compromised by malicious attacks, even with interference enforcement in place.},

  abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in
comparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains. But BFT-based protocols
suffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the
network. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message
complexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT
performance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message
complexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes
the protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network
will face a a certain number of failures.
  As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable
(i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this
issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a
subset of nodes \$c\$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance,
regardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the
quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to \$O(cn)\$, where
\$c{$<<$}n\$, for large \$n\$.
  Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when \$c\$ is
asymptotically smaller than \$n\$, and this helps the protocol to provide stable
performance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our
view change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the
whole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols.
We deployed and tested our protocol on \$200\$ Amazon \$EC2\$ instances, with two
different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In these
tests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than \$2\textbackslash{}times\$ in terms
of throughput as well as latency.},

This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions. Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes. Furthermore, it accommodates high loads, as it is able to handle sixteen times more security events per second than what was processed by the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) infrastructure employed in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.},

  shorttitle = {Hybrid {{Consensus}}},
  abstract = {Consensus, or state machine replication is a foundational building block of distributed systems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical, permissioned setting has been extensively studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recent developments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized a new form of consensus in a “permissionless” setting, where anyone can join and leave dynamically, and there is no a-priori knowledge of the consensus nodes. Despite this exciting breakthrough, today’s permissionless consensus protocols, often referred to as “blockchains”, are known to have terrible performance, which has resulted in heated, and at times acrimonious debates in the community. First, we show that unfortunately a performance loss is inherent for any protocol that secures against at least 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Specifically, we formally define a new performance measure called responsiveness, and show that any responsive permissionless consensus protocol cannot tolerate 1/3 or more corruptions in hashpower. Next, we show a tightly matching uppper bound. Specifically, we propose a new permissionless consensus protocol called hybrid consensus, that is responsive and secures against up to 1/3 corruptions in hashpower. Hybrid consensus's idea is to bootstrap fast permissionless consensus by combining an inefficient blockchain protocol with a fast permissioned consensus protocol. Hybrid consensus uses the blockchain not to agree on transactions, but to agree on rotating committees which in turn execute permissioned consensus protocols to agree on transactions. While the high-level idea is intuitive, formally instantiating and reasoning about the protocol exposed a multitude of non-trivial technical subtleties and challenges.},

In that vein, blockchain may be a suitable complement to ontologies to achieve a big part of the vision of the semantic Web by Tim Berners-Lee. We believe that if this complementarity is to be achieved blockchain and ontologies must co-evolve. In this paper, we focus on what and how to engineer models, methods, designs, and implementations for this co-evolution. As a first step in this co-evolution, we propose a conceptual design of a governance ontology represented as meta-data tags to be embedded and instantiated in a smart contract at the blockchain protocol level. We develop this design by examining and analyzing smart contracts from the infamous The DAO experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe there are two contributions of this paper: it serves to inform and implore the blockchain and ontology communities to recognize and collaborate with each other; and it outlines a roadmap for engineering artifacts to bridge the gap between blockchain community focus on protocol-level blockchain interoperability and the ontology community focus on semantic-level interoperability.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Bitcoin Backbone Protocol}}},
  abstract = {Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptions on the hashing power of the adversary relative to network synchronicity; we show our results to be tight under high synchronization. Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built on top of the backbone protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto's suggestion falls short of solving it, and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary's hashing power is bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin's operation as a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and that the adversary's hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed for security decreases as the network desynchronizes. Finally, we show that our analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol for synchronous networks extends with relative ease to the recently considered partially synchronous model, where there is an upper bound in the delay of messages that is unknown to the honest parties.},

  shorttitle = {Majority {{Is Not Enough}}},
  abstract = {The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.
We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.
Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than \textbackslash{}(1/4\textbackslash{}) of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed \textbackslash{}(1/2\textbackslash{}) bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.},

In recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy and penetrated different domains, mostly due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. One field where blockchain technology has tremendous potential is healthcare, due to the need for a more patient-centric approach to healthcare systems and to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of electronic healthcare records (EHRs). In this systematic review, an analysis of state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the potential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions of blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by a description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given, which includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the results of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis. The findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly used for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare. Most research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures or models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype implementation or implementation details. Often even with a prototype implementation, no details about blockchain elements are given.},

  abstract = {In a few short years the Internet of Things has become an intrinsic part of everyday life, with connected devices included in products created for homes, cars and even medical equipment. But its rapid growth has created several security problems, with respect to the transmission and storage of vast amounts of customers data, across an insecure heterogeneous collection of networks. The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from. Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited. However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data. Within this paper a cross section of blockchain consensus protocols have been assessed against a requirement framework, to establish each consensus protocols strengths and weaknesses with respect to their potential implementation in an Internet of Things blockchain environment.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Byzantine consensus algorithms have seen a surge in popularitywith the rise of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. A major problem that hampersadoption of existing consensus algorithms in blockchain scenarios is their scalability. There has been much research in the past years aiming to optimize thesealgorithms and increase their efficiency. For example, recent work has shown that voting rounds present in many classical algorithms can be made drastically more efficient by the use of message aggregation techniques.

Another trend is towards the usage of trusted hardware to increase performance and lower resource requirementsof these algorithms. Trusted hardware enables algorithms to reduce the lower bound on the number of replicas from \$3f+1\$ to \$2f+1\$, where \$f\$ is the number of tolerated faults. Currently, all existing Byzantine consensus algorithms either use no trusted hardware at all, or assume that all replicas have access to the same trusted hardware. This leaves a gap in the design space, neglecting scenarios where only some machines have access to trusted hardware. 

In this work, we investigate the possibilities where only a subset of all replicas has access to trusted hardware. We introduce the SACBFT framework, consisting of two transformations that can be applied to existing Byzantine consensus protocols, increasing their efficiency by allowing them to make use of trusted hardware that exists in the system.

We apply the framework to PBFT and RePBFT to produce SACPBFT and SACRePBFT respectively, and show how to apply the framework to other protocols. We also evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of SACPBFT, showing that it can dramatically reduce network usage and increase performance even when only a single replica has access to trusted hardware.},

  abstract = {Distributed Ledgers (e.g. Bitcoin) occupy currently the first lines of the economical and political media and many speculations are done with respect to their level of coherence and their computability power. 
Interestingly, there is no consensus on the properties and abstractions that fully capture the behaviour of distributed ledgers. The interest in formalising the behaviour of distributed ledgers is twofold. Firstly, it helps to prove the correctness of the algorithms that implement existing distributed ledgers and explore their limits with respect to an unfriendly environment and target applications.
\%
Secondly, it facilitates the identification of  the minimal building blocks necessary to implement the distributed ledger  in a specific environment. 

Even though the behaviour of distributed ledgers is similar to abstractions that have been deeply  studied for decades in distributed systems  no abstraction is sufficiently powerful to capture the distributed ledger behaviour.

This paper introduces the Distributed Ledger Register, a register  that mimics the behaviour of one of the most popular distributed ledger, i.e. the Bitcoin ledger. The aim of our work is to provide formal guarantees on the coherent evolution of Bitcoin. We furthermore show that the Bitcoin blockchain maintenance algorithm verifies the distributed ledger register properties under strict conditions.  Moreover, we prove that the Distributed Ledger Register verifies the regularity register specification. It follows   that the strongest coherency implemented by Bitcoin is  regularity under strong assumptions (i.e. partial synchronous systems and  sparse reads). This study contradicts the common belief that Bitcoin implements strong coherency criteria in a totally asynchronous system. 
 To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that makes the connection between the distributed ledgers and the classical theory of distributed shared registers.},

It has the intention to provide the reader with a working appreciation of the Byzantine failure from a practical as well as a theoretical perspective.

These requirements usually result in single-threaded replicas, which hinders service performance. This paper introduces Parallel State-Machine Replication (P-SMR), a new approach to parallelism in state-machine replication. P-SMR scales better than previous proposals since no component plays a centralizing role in the execution of independent commands-those that can be executed concurrently, as defined by the service. The paper introduces P-SMR, describes a "commodified architecture" to implement it, and compares its performance to other proposals using a key-value store and a networked file system.},

  abstract = {In recent years, measuring instruments have become quite complex due to the integration of embedded systems and software components and the increasing aggregation of new features. Consequently, metrological regulation and control require more efforts from notiﬁed bodies, becoming slower and more expensive. In this paper, we evaluate the use of blockchains as a resource to overcome such challenges. We start with a conceptual model for implementing measuring instruments in a distributed blockchain-based architecture and compare it with traditional measuring instruments and distributed measuring models discussed in previous works. We also made a security analysis, demonstrating that blockchain-based measuring systems can impact the way measuring instruments are used in consumer relations while improving security and simplifying metrological regulation and control. We implement a vehicle speed measuring system using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. We evaluate the security and performance of our blockchain-based measuring system by executing tests with data from real speed meter sensors. The results are promising and validate the feasibility of our idea. Finally, we point out the main challenges related to our approach, suggesting alternatives and potential issues to be addressed by future works.},

  abstract = {State machine replication (SMR) in distributed computing is fundamental when employing redundancy of storage to facilitate fault-tolerance. It aims at maintaining the consistency of the state of several copies of a -possibly dynamic- distributed object, thus, providing increased availability. At the same time, it strives to reduce the impact on the system’s performance. Research on cloud systems has significantly benefited from accumulated knowledge on SMR to quickly progress towards making cloud services efficient and reliable. Two established paradigms providing SMR are consensus and virtual synchrony (VS). Consensus-based SMR algorithms are widely studied and used, and well understood. Recently, Byzantine-tolerant SMR was proposed as an alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) paradigm of block ordering in blockchains. This is because it is suggested to overcome the poor performance scalability of PoW and avoid the high energy consumptions. On the other hand, systems that provide the VS property are today directed towards high-speed cloud services.
Systems implementing SMR provide guarantees based on assumptions like bounded churn rates, bounded replica failures, failure-free probabilistic error de- tection mechanisms, or that system variables are started in a consistent state. If these are, even temporarily, violated due to the occurrence of transient faults, then this may corrupt the state of a single or multiple replicas, including its program coun- ters. Subsequently, this leads the system to an arbitrary state, causing it to become possibly unavailable, unless there is human intervention. Self-stabilizing systems enhance existing fault tolerant systems to allow them to automatically recover from transient failures. In this way, and combined with other fault-tolerance techniques, self-stabilization provides a comprehensive and robust fault-resilience and recovery strategy.
This thesis proposes self-stabilizing algorithmic solutions with proven guarantees to several SMR-related problems. In this framework, we initially present the first practically-self-stabilizing VS-based SMR for a static crash-prone replica set. We then introduce dynamicity in the membership of the replica set, and provide a modular self-stabilizing reconfiguration scheme that can lead to self-stabilizing reconfigurable SMR (based on either VS or consensus). We then address the more challenging failure model of Byzantine faults, and propose a malicious-tolerant self-stabilizing SMR algorithm based on implementable failure detectors. The thesis also bears several by-products such as a self-stabilizing counter that can be incremented in distributed fashion, and novel design and proof techniques. Considered together, the three results cover a significant gap towards achieving self-stabilizing versions of SMR-based blockchain frameworks or of reconfigurable Byzantine-tolerant SMRs.},

  abstract = {One of the main reasons why Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems are not widely used lies in their high resource consumption: 3f+1 replicas are necessary to tolerate only f faults. Recent works have been able to reduce the minimum number of replicas to 2f+1 by relying on a trusted subsystem that prevents a replica from making conflicting statements to other replicas without being detected. Nevertheless, having been designed with the focus on fault handling, these systems still employ a majority of replicas during normal-case operation for seemingly redundant work. Furthermore, the trusted subsystems available trade off performance for security; that is, they either achieve high throughput or they come with a small trusted computing base. This paper presents CheapBFT, a BFT system that, for the first time, tolerates that all but one of the replicas active in normal-case operation become faulty. CheapBFT runs a composite agreement protocol and exploits passive replication to save resources; in the absence of faults, it requires that only f+1 replicas actively agree on client requests and execute them. In case of suspected faulty behavior, CheapBFT triggers a transition protocol that activates f extra passive replicas and brings all non-faulty replicas into a consistent state again. This approach, for example, allows the system to safely switch to another, more resilient agreement protocol. CheapBFT relies on an FPGA-based trusted subsystem for the authentication of protocol messages that provides high performance and comprises a small trusted computing base.},

The guifi.net community network is a successful example of a digital infrastructure, a computer network, managed as an open commons. Inspired by the guifi.net case and its commons governance model, we claim that a computing cloud, another digital infrastructure, can also be managed as an open commons if the appropriate tools are put in place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons.},

  shorttitle = {Troxy},
  abstract = {Various protocols and architectures have been proposed to make Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) increasingly practical. However, the deployment of such systems requires dedicated client-side functionality. This is necessary as clients have to connect to multiple replicas and perform majority voting over the received replies to outvote faulty responses. Deploying custom client-side code is cumbersome, and often not an option, especially in open heterogeneous systems and for well-established protocols (e.g., HTTP and IMAP) where diverse client-side implementations co-exist. We propose Troxy, a system which relocates the BFT-specific client-side functionality to the server side, thereby making BFT transparent to legacy clients. To achieve this, Troxy relies on a trusted subsystem built upon hardware protection enabled by Intel SGX. Additionally, Troxy reduces the replication cost of BFT for read-heavy workloads by offering an actively maintained cache that supports trustworthy read operations while preserving the consistency guarantees offered by the underlying BFT protocol. A prototype of Troxy has been built and evaluated, and results indicate that using Troxy (1) leads to at most 43\% performance loss with small ordered messages in a local network environment, while (2) improves throughput by 130\% with read-heavy workloads in a simulated wide-area network.},

We present ZZ, a new approach that reduces the replication cost of BFT services from 2f + 1 to practically f + 1. The key insight in ZZ is to use f + 1 execution replicas in the normal case and to activate additional replicas only upon failures. In data centers where multiple applications share a physical server, ZZ reduces the aggregate number of execution replicas running in the data center, improving throughput and response times. ZZ relies on virtualization—a technology already employed in modern data centers—for fast replica activation upon failures, and enables newly activated replicas to immediately begin processing requests by fetching state on-demand. A prototype implementation of ZZ using the BASE library and Xen shows that, when compared to a system with 2f + 1 replicas, our approach yields lower response times and up to 33\% higher throughput in a prototype data center with four BFT web applications. We also show that ZZ can handle simultaneous failures and achieve sub-second recovery.},

  shorttitle = {Token-Based Cloud Computing},
  abstract = {Secure outsourcing of computation to an untrusted (cloud) service provider is becoming more and more important. Pure cryptographic solutions based on fully homomorphic and verifiable encryption, recently proposed, are promising but suffer from very high latency. Other proposals perform the whole computation on tamper-proof hardware and usually suffer from the the same problem. Trusted computing (TC) is another promising approach that uses trusted software and hardware components on computing platforms to provide useful mechanisms such as attestation allowing the data owner to verify the integrity of the cloud and its computation. However, on the one hand these solutions require trust in hardware (CPU, trusted computing modules) that are under the physical control of the cloud provider, and on the other hand they still have to face the challenge of run-time attestation. In this paper we focus on applications where the latency of the computation should be minimized, i.e., the time from submitting the query until receiving the outcome of the computation should be as small as possible. To achieve this we show how to combine a trusted hardware token (e.g., a cryptographic coprocessor or provided by the customer) with Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) to compute arbitrary functions on secret (encrypted) data where the computation leaks no information and is verifiable. The token is used in the setup phase only whereas in the time-critical online phase the cloud computes the encrypted function on encrypted data using symmetric encryption primitives only and without any interaction with other entities.},

We show that amazingly, not only can this new paradigm achieve consensus (e.g., on a batch of unconfirmed transactions in a cryptocurrency system), but it also allows us to derive the first SMR protocol which, even under adaptive corruptions, requires only polylogarithmically many rounds and polylogarithmically many honest messages to be multicast to confirm each batch of transactions; and importantly, we attain these guarantees under standard cryptographic assumptions.},

  abstract = {The old mantra of decentralizing the Internet is coming again with fanfare, this time around the blockchain technology hype. We have already seen a technology supposed to change the nature of the Internet: peer-to-peer. The reality is that peer-to-peer naming systems failed, peer-to-peer social networks failed, and yes, peer-to-peer storage failed as well. In this paper, we will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to identify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like system complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will show how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of permissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature industrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so interesting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their pseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that permissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a decentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization, albeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of decentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the superpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from the recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned blockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties is not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of establish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control from the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric computing.},

Inexact communication is inherent for clock synchronization protocols. We prove that validity and agreement properties hold for inexact communication, and that exact communication is a special case.

  abstract = {Interactive consistency is the problem in which n nodes, where up to t may be byzantine, each with its own private value, run an algorithm that allows all non-faulty nodes to infer the values of each other node. This problem is relevant to critical applications that rely on the combination of the opinions of multiple peers to provide a service. Examples include monitoring a content source to prevent equivocation or to track variability in the content provided, and resolving divergent state amongst the nodes of a distributed system. Previous works assume a fully synchronous system, where one can make strong assumptions such as negligible message delivery delays and/or detection of absent messages. However, practical, real-world systems are mostly asynchronous, i.e., they exhibit only some periods of synchrony during which message delivery is timely, thus requiring a different approach. In this paper, we present a thorough study on practical interactive consistency. We leverage the vast prior work on broadcast and byzantine consensus algorithms to design, implement and evaluate a set of algorithms, with varying timing assumptions and message complexity, that can be used to achieve interactive consistency in real-world distributed systems. We provide a complete, open-source implementation of each proposed interactive consistency algorithm by building a multi-layered stack of protocols that include several broadcast protocols, as well as a binary and a multi-valued consensus protocol. Most of these protocols have never been implemented and evaluated in a real system before. We analyze the performance of our suite of algorithms experimentally by engaging in both single instance and multiple parallel instances of each alternative.},

It was introduced to model and analyze the effects of very severe hardware faults in aircraft control systems. Lately, the Byzantine failure model has been used in the area of network security where Byzantine-tolerance is equated with resilience against malicious attackers. We discuss two reasons why one should be careful in doing so. Firstly, Byzantine-tolerance is not concerned with secrecy and so special means have to be employed if secrecy is a desired system property. Secondly, in contrast to the domain of hardware faults, in a security setting it is difﬁcult to compute the assumption coverage of the Byzantine failure model, i.e., the probability that the failure assumption holds in practice. For this latter point we develop a methodology which allows to estimate the reliability of a Byzantine-tolerant solution exposed to attackers of different strengths.},

We develop a formal model using concepts from modern cryptography, give modular deﬁnitions for several broadcast problems, including reliable, atomic, and secure causal broadcast, and present protocols implementing them. Reliable broadcast is a basic primitive, also known as the Byzantine generals problem, providing agreement on a delivered message. Atomic broadcast imposes additionally a total order on all delivered messages. We present a randomized atomic broadcast protocol based on a new, eﬃcient multi-valued asynchronous Byzantine agreement primitive with an external validity condition. Apparently, no such eﬃcient asynchronous atomic broadcast protocol maintaining liveness and safety in the Byzantine model has appeared previously in the literature. Secure causal broadcast extends atomic broadcast by encryption to guarantee a causal order among the delivered messages. Our protocols use threshold cryptography for signatures, encryption, and coin-tossing.},

  shorttitle = {The Invisible Politics of {{Bitcoin}}},
  abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform. Teaser: As a trustless technology, Bitcoin tries to solve issues of social coordination and economic exchange by relying, only and exclusively, on technological means. Yet, when looking deeper into the governance structure of this technology, it becomes apparent that technology alone is unable to resolve most of the social and political concerns affecting the Bitcoin network.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technologies have generated excitement, yet their potential to enable new forms of governance remains largely unexplored. Two confronting standpoints dominate the emergent debate around blockchain-based governance: discourses characterised by the presence of techno-determinist and market-driven values, which tend to ignore the complexity of social organisation; and critical accounts of such discourses which, whilst contributing to identifying limitations, consider the role of traditional centralised institutions as inherently necessary to enable democratic forms of governance. Therefore the question arises, can we build perspectives of blockchain-based governance that go beyond markets and states? In this article we draw on the Nobel laureate economist Elinor Ostrom's principles for self-governance of communities to explore the transformative potential of blockchain. We approach blockchain through the identification and conceptualisation of affordances that this technology may provide to communities. For each affordance, we carry out a detailed analysis situating each in the context of Ostrom's principles, considering both the potentials of algorithmic governance and the importance of incorporating communities' social practices. The relationships found between these affordances and Ostrom's principles allow us to provide a perspective focussed on blockchain-based commons governance. By carrying out this analysis, we aim to expand the debate from one dominated by a culture of competition to one that promotes a culture of cooperation.},

  url = {http://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1079},
  abstract = {Most classical consensus protocols rely on a leader to coordinate nodes’ voting efforts. One novel idea that stems from blockchain-style consensus is to rely, instead, on a “longest-chain” idea for such coordination. Such a longest-chain idea was initially considered in randomized protocols, where in each round, a node has some probability of being elected a leader who can propose the next block. Recently, well-known systems have started implementing the deterministic counterpart of such longest-chain protocols — the deterministic counterpart is especially attractive since it is even simpler to implement than their randomized cousins. A notable instantiation is the Aura protocol which is shipped with Parity’s open-source Ethereum implementation. Interestingly, mathematical analyses of deterministic, longest-chain protocols are lacking even though there exist several analyses of randomized versions. In this paper, we provide the first formal analysis of deterministic, longest-chain-style consensus. We show that a variant of the Aura protocol can defend against a Byzantine adversary that controls fewer than 1/3 fraction of the nodes, and this resilience parameter is tight by some technical interpretation. Based on insights gained through our mathematical treatment, we point out that Aura’s concrete instantiation actually fails to achieve the resiliene level they claim. Finally, while our tight proof for the longest-chain protocol is rather involved and non-trivial; we show that a variant of the “longest-chain” idea which we call “largest-set” enables a textbook construction that admits a simple proof (albeit with slower confirmation).},

We then introduce the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend in each of these protocols with a single malicious node. Our results show that the Cloning Attack against Aura is always successful while the same attack against Clique is about twice as fast and succeeds in most cases.},

As opposed to previous algorithms that cannot terminate in the presence of a faulty or slow coordinator, our algorithm can terminate even when its coordinator is faulty, hence the name weak coordinator. The key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as they receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message from a coordinator that may be slow. The resulting algorithm assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal, time optimal and does not need signatures. Our presentation is didactic: we first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue consensus to binary consensus that may terminate in 4 message delays. To evaluate our algorithm, we deployed it on 100 machines distributed in 5 datacenters across different continents and compared its performance against the randomized solution from Mostefaoui, Moumem and Raynal [PODC14] that terminates in O(1) rounds in expectation. Our algorithm always outperforms the latter even in the presence of Byzantine behaviors. Our algorithm has a subsecond average latency in most of our geo-distributed experiments, even when attacked by a well-engineered coalition of Byzantine processes.},

To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries located on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain, called the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand transactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped into blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by permissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique block is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all participants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine fault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same geo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting comparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the classic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains cannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees transaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that randomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical evaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without sacrificing security.},
